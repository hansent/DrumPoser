DrumPoser 0.0.1 - By A.J. Venter
GPL 3.0

About: 
DrumPoser is a musical composition tool for drummers.
It is designed to compose beats in an easy but musically correct 
manner which can then be exported into normal notation, replayed
or saved internally. 
DrumPoser is NOT a drum machine and wouldn't be very useful as one.
It's designed to be used alongside (not instead off) a physical drum-set,
either electronic or accoustic. 
To this end DrumPoser includes a tool to help teach you to play your 
composed beats correctly on the drumkit. 

DrumPoser is multiplatform and supports several mobile devices. This is 
particularly useful as it means for the first time Drummers can compose
and work on beats while on the go - without having to work from memory to 
paper - and then have those beats ready to learn when they are back at
their kits.

Status:
This is a first and early pre-release intended to show the design
and seek contribution. Do not consider it ready for production use yet.
